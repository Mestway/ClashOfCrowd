\section{Milestones}

There are two milestone reports in the quarter, one early and one late. These are opportunities for feedback and guidance from staff and classmates.

Explain what your group will plan to accomplish by each of these milestones. You will be asked to revisit these plans during those milestone reports.

What might the group explicitly decide to omit?

Progress requires compromise, as you cannot accomplish everything. Explain what aspects of the project you might choose to ignore or defer in this course. This is your opportunity to scope the project appropriately for this course.
